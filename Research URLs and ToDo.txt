Arduino is running bonjour service to allow for discovery without configuration by avahi program which is pre-built into Ubunto which will be run on the RPi.

TODO:

Create test environment of Ubuntu on USB stick.

Use Avahi to scan all devices on network and add all devices with 'arduino' in their broadcast name to a list along with details such as IP address and MAC address.

Create a PHP / Python script to periodically check these devices and add new devices to a database

Develop database

Develop android app (reads device list from Database?)
